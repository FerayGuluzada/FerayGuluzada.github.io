<h1>About SITE faculty</h1>
<img id="about" src="img/7.jpg" alt="">
<h3>Dean Araz Yusubov</h3>  
<p class="yazi">" Our goal is that at the end of each course our students would not only say 'I know', they would also say 'I can'. We see SITE students as ambitious minds aspired to tackle global challenges, as decent citizens committed to the highest ethical standards, and as able young professionals ready to use the power of technologies for bringing solutions to real life problems. Their study programs are not only about technical knowledge and skills, they learn how to communicate efficiently, to persuade and lead others towards a common mission."
<br>
SITEâ€™s home faculty are leading professionals who are dedicated to being at the forefront of teaching and cutting-edge research and discovery. They challenge conventional thinking and encourage students to go beyond the status quo in order to practice innovative approaches. This, in return, creates a constant dynamic conversation on learning through experiencing. Thinking and problem-solving connect here by taking a holistic view on issues with the understanding gained through knowledge across disciplines.</p>
