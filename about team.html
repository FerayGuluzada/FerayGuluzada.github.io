<h3>Team 16</h3>  
<p class="yazi">Our group consisting of first-year students of ADA University Feray Gulu-Zade, Tural Alizada and Atilla Sharifli and third-year student Madina Rustamova was created by teachers of our university's SITE faculty Araz Yusuvov and Nureddin Sadili. Like other rival teams, they brought us together to learn the team work by completing the given projects together.
<br>
<br>I would like to thank Araz and Nuraddin muallim for giving us this opportunity in our first year, because thanks to this group work, we will get to know each other better in our first year and we will not get tired of doing our homework. In this way, my groupmates and I were able to properly complete the first project given by our teachers. And this website was the second project we had to complete, which, like the other, we showed great determination and resilience and were able to cope with the project.</p>
