<h2>About Hour of Code Project</h2>
<p> Our hour of code event was 
held on 12th of December at 15:00. 
There were 20 participants from 10 to 15 
years old interested in coding selected by
the principal of <strong>Kalbajar Middle School No.99</strong>. 
Due to the pandemics the event was held online. 
Students were briefly introduced to <em>ADA University</em>. 
Then, they dived into the coding world with the help of the classic maze.
Throughout the session, they solved tasks and received 2 certificates in the end.</p>

<div id="Detailed Report">
<p>Our hour of code was held on the 12th of December at 15:00
via Microsoft Teams with the students of Kalbajar Secondary School No.99. 
We gathered 24 people interested in coding together to show them that coding is not 
as hard as it seems by completing the classic maze together. We were happy to see 
that some of the students joined from one device and participated with their siblings. 
We decided to get to know each other before the hour of code to make it more comfortable 
for the students considering the pressure of the pandemics. 
The next day, we started our hour of code by introducing ADA University. 
Surprisingly, the majority of the students were very interested in 
the university and were asking questions days after the session. 
We gladly answered all of them. Then, we discussed computers, 
their roles in our lives and tried to break the stereotypes about 
the difficulty of programming. After that we proceeded with the maze. 
Since some of the students joined from one device, we decided to complete the maze 
all together. We first explained the purpose of the game, and how to use the blocks 
to build a simple program. We showed different types of blocks and how to use them on 
the presentation we prepared. Then, with the help of the volunteers, we solved every 
single level on the maze. Since the students completed the maze very fast, we decided 
to complete some of the levels from our ICT homework to satisfy their interests. 
At the end of the session, we asked the students to describe what happened during 
the hour of code in one sentence and shared our inspirational stories. 
As it turns out, their courses at school do not satisfy their interests that much and 
they have never done anything like this before. They were extremely happy to receive 
2 certificates: one from code.org and one from us. They complimented us
a lot and some even called us brothers and sisters. We were happy to see that we managed 
to meet their expectations and create a sibling bond between us.</p>
